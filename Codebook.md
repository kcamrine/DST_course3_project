# This is a description of the tidy dataset run_analysis_output_tidy.txt

From the initial study (website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones# ):
"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz."


All data is summarized (mean and standard deviation (std)) over multiple measurements split into windows of 2.56 seconds with 50% overlap of other windows. We then take the average for each individual over all of the means and standard deviations to summarize all timeframes. 

## Data Description (in order of column appearance):

"subject"                     the subject identifier, ranging from subject 1 to subject 30.
"activity"		      the activity any subject was engaging in for the averages computed

### for the following variables, we have the body and gravity acceleration which were calculated at a constant rate of 50 hz, averaged over timeframe means. 
"tBodyAcc-mean()-X"	      
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"
"tGravityAcc-mean()-X"
"tGravityAcc-mean()-Y"
"tGravityAcc-mean()-Z"

### for the following variables, body linear acceleration and angular velocity allowed for computation of the acceleration jerk averaged over timeframe means
"tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X"
"tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y"
"tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z"
"tBodyGyro-mean()-X"
"tBodyGyro-mean()-Y"
"tBodyGyro-mean()-Z"
"tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X"
"tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y"
"tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z"

### the euclidian norm  (denoted as "mag") was added to these varaibles, and then the mean was calculated over all timeframe means
"tBodyAccMag-mean()"
"tGravityAccMag-mean()"
"tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()"
"tBodyGyroMag-mean()"
"tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()"
